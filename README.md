# video_projector

Dual-projector blending with **video support**, a test GUI, a crop/fit picture mode and a shared
start time. It is the video version of the PBL4 dual-projector project (`projector_pbl4`), kept
in its own repository. The submission zip includes the test pictures and the test video
`test_images/demo.mp4`. A Git clone has the test pictures but not the test video: it is made
the first time `instant_run.py` runs, or with `python tools/make_test_video.py`. Your own
pictures or videos go wherever `sourcePath` points.

## Quick start

**1. Install (once).** Unzip `video_projector.zip` and open a terminal in the `video_projector`
folder (or clone it: `git clone https://github.com/maksym-syd/video_projector.git` and
`cd video_projector`).

With [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (to install uv, see [Option A](#option-a-using-uv-recommended) below):

```bash
uv sync
```

Without uv, any Python 3.12 or newer works (get it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

`requirements-dev.txt` includes `pytest` for the tests. `requirements.txt` has only what is
needed to run the program. On Windows, type `py` instead of `python3`.

**2. Try it on one computer (no projectors needed):**

```bash
uv run python instant_run.py       # without uv: python instant_run.py
```

A window shows both sides joined, with the test video playing (it is made the first time). Press
`q` or `ESC` to close it.

**3. Run it on the two projectors.** On the laptop for the left projector:

```bash
uv run python instant_run.py --left --start-in 30      # without uv: python instant_run.py --left --start-in 30
```

It prints the command for the right laptop, with the same start time. Run that on the second
laptop within 30 seconds, and both start together. More options are in
[Quick test on the projectors](#quick-test-on-the-projectors).

**4. Run the tests:**

```bash
uv run pytest                      # without uv: pytest
```

All tests should pass (about 570; one may be skipped).

## Settings

The settings are in a JSON file. `settings.json` shows a picture (`test_images/grid.png`), and
`settings.video.json` shows the test video (`test_images/demo.mp4`). `instant_run.py` uses
`settings.video.json`, and `settings.json` with `--image`.

| Field | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `projectorResXY` | Resolution of one projector in pixels, `[width, height]` | `[1920, 1080]` |
| `imageWidthCm` (`w`) | Width of the picture of **one** projector on the wall, in cm | `134.0` |
| `projectorSpacingCm` (`d`) | Distance between the two projected pictures, in cm, measured left edge to left edge (the same as centre to centre). The overlap is `w - d`, so `d` must be smaller than `w` | `108.0` |
| `blendCurveGamma` | Shape of the fade in the overlap, from 0.5 to 3.0. 2.0 gave an even join on our projectors; 1.0 left a dark line | `2.0` |
| `sourcePath` | Picture (`.jpg`, `.png`, ...) or video (`.mp4`, `.m4v`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.mkv`, `.webm`). A relative path is relative to the settings file, here the project folder | `test_images/grid.png` |
| `projectorSide` | `LEFT` or `RIGHT`: the projector this computer drives. `--side` overrides it | `LEFT` |
| `scaleMode` | `crop` (default) or `fit`, see [Picture proportions](#picture-proportions). `--scale-mode` overrides it | `crop` |

Both computers use the same file. Only `projectorSide` differs, or give `--side` on the command
line. To check that the files on the two computers match (the side may differ):

```bash
python tools/check_settings.py settings.json other_settings.json
```

### How to measure w and d

1. Turn on both projectors and show the full-screen test pattern on each laptop:
   `python tools/show_test_pattern.py --width 1920 --height 1080` (use `--screen` to choose
   the projector's screen).
2. With a tape measure, measure the width of one projected picture. That is `w`.
3. Measure the distance from the left edge of the left picture to the left edge of the right
   picture. That is `d`. It must be smaller than `w`.
4. Write both values, in cm, into the settings file on both computers.

## Requirements

- Python **3.14** (pinned in `.python-version`; uv installs it). With pip, Python 3.12 and 3.13 work too
- Dependencies (defined in `pyproject.toml`, locked in `uv.lock`)
  - Runtime: `numpy`, `opencv-python`
  - Development: `pytest`

---

## Option A: Using uv (recommended)

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) manages the Python version, the virtual environment, and dependencies in one tool.

### 1. Install uv

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Alternatives**

```bash
brew install uv      # Homebrew
pipx install uv      # pipx
pip install uv       # pip
```

Restart your terminal, then check the installation:

```bash
uv --version
```

See the [official installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for more options.

### 2. Set up the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maksym-syd/video_projector.git
cd video_projector
uv sync
```

`uv sync` downloads Python 3.14 if needed, creates `.venv/`, and installs the exact versions from `uv.lock`.

### 3. Run the code

```bash
uv run python instant_run.py       # quick test, see Quick start above
uv run python main.py settings.json --side LEFT
uv run pytest                      # run the tests
```

`uv run` always uses the project's virtual environment, so you don't need to activate it.

### Managing dependencies

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Add a runtime dependency | `uv add <package>` |
| Add a development dependency | `uv add --dev <package>` |
| Remove a dependency | `uv remove <package>` |
| Upgrade locked versions | `uv lock --upgrade` |
| Sync after pulling changes | `uv sync` |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you change dependencies, regenerate the requirements files (see [Option B](#option-b-without-uv-pip--venv)) and commit `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `requirements.txt`, and `requirements-dev.txt` together.

---

## Option B: Without uv (pip + venv)

If you can't install uv, you can use the standard `venv` and `pip` tools.

### 1. Install Python

Python 3.14 is recommended (it is the version pinned for uv). With pip, Python 3.12 and 3.13
work too. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and check the version:

```bash
python3 --version   # Windows: py --version
```

The commands below use `python3` (Windows: `py`). To pick a version when several are installed,
use for example `python3.14` (Windows: `py -3.14`).

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maksym-syd/video_projector.git
cd video_projector
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/maksym-syd/video_projector.git
cd video_projector
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3. Install dependencies

The requirements files are exported from `uv.lock`, so pip installs the same versions as uv:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # runtime + development (pytest)
# or, runtime only:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the code

With the virtual environment activated:

```bash
python instant_run.py              # quick test, see Quick start above
python main.py settings.json --side LEFT
pytest                             # run the tests (needs requirements-dev.txt)
```

Run `deactivate` to leave the virtual environment.

> [!NOTE]
> `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` are generated files. Don't edit them by hand. After you change dependencies with uv, regenerate them:
>
> ```bash
> uv export --no-hashes --no-dev --format requirements-txt -o requirements.txt
> uv export --no-hashes --format requirements-txt -o requirements-dev.txt
> ```

---

## Quick test on the projectors

One short command shows the test video on the real projectors. Both laptops need this
repository and the environment installed (Option A or B above). With uv, put `uv run` in front.

```bash
python instant_run.py --left
```

It starts `main.py` with `settings.video.json` and a shared start time 5 seconds from now, so no
key press is needed. It prints the exact command for the second laptop, with the opposite side
and the same time. Both laptops need the same clock and time zone, set to automatic time. A
laptop that starts late joins at the right frame.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `python instant_run.py --left` or `--right` | Real show on this laptop's projector |
| `python instant_run.py --left --start-in 30` | Start in 30 seconds, for time to reach the second laptop |
| `python instant_run.py --left --start-at 14:30:05` | Start at a given time, in the same forms as `main.py` |
| `python instant_run.py --left --image` | Show the picture from `settings.json`, which has no start time |
| `python instant_run.py` | Preview on this computer, no projectors needed; add `--image` for the picture |
| `python instant_run.py --gui` | Open the test GUI; add `--image` for the picture |

If `test_images/demo.mp4` is missing, it is made first. `q` or `ESC` closes the window.

## Project structure

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `pipeline_class.py` | Main pipeline: load → scale → crop → apply mask → display |
| `setup_class.py` | Loads and validates the configuration (resolution, image width, projector spacing, gamma, source path, side) |
| `math_class.py` | Calculations for overlap, pixels per cm, crop region, and blend mask |
| `region.py` | Crop region (x start and width in pixels) |
| `mask.py` | Blend mask (alpha values) |
| `side.py` | `Side` enum (`LEFT` / `RIGHT`) |
| `image.py`, `display.py` | Image and display classes |
| `instant_run.py` | One short command for a quick test: starts `main.py`, `tools/preview_both.py` or `gui.py` |
| `gui.py` | Test window: settings, joined preview, start on the projector |
| `video_source.py` | Reads video files frame by frame (`VideoSource`) |
| `tools/check_settings.py` | Checks one settings file, or that two settings files match (the side may differ) |

> [!NOTE]
> The modules are generated from a UML model. Keep the `# ˅` / `# ˄` markers and write your code between them so it is kept when the code is regenerated.

## Pictures and videos

`sourcePath` can point at a picture (`.jpg`, `.png`, ...) or at a video
(`.mp4`, `.m4v`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.mkv`, `.webm`). The file extension decides which.

For a video, each computer:

1. shows the first frame of its own side;
2. starts playing either when you press any key, or at a **shared start time** (see below);
3. picks each frame from the clock, not by counting, so a slow computer skips frames and
   does not fall behind the other one;
4. loops when the video ends;
5. stops when you press `q` or `ESC`.

### Shared start time

```bash
python main.py settings.json --side LEFT  --start-at 14:30:05
python main.py settings.json --side RIGHT --start-at 14:30:05
```

Give the same time (local time, `HH:MM`, `HH:MM:SS` or `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`) on both computers.
They wait on the first frame and start together, with no key press. A computer that starts
after that time joins at the frame that belongs to that moment, so both still match. The
two computers' clocks must be set right (use automatic time, for example NTP); how close
they stay depends on how close the clocks are. In the GUI, the field "Video start at" does
the same, and "In 15 s" / "In 30 s" fill in a time a little ahead of now.

### Picture proportions

`scaleMode` in the settings (or `--scale-mode` on the command line):

- `crop` (default): the picture fills the whole combined image and the extra edges are cut off.
- `fit`: the whole picture is shown, with black bars where its proportions do not match.

Without a start time the two computers start together only as well as the two key presses.
Expect a small offset (a tenth of a second or so). Video has no sound. If a file will not open, the codec is not
supported by OpenCV: re-encode it as H.264 `.mp4`.

## Test GUI

```bash
python gui.py [settings.json]
```

The same "like the wall" view is available in `tools/preview_both.py` with `--projector-gamma 2.2`.

A window for trying things on one computer, without projectors:

- edit the settings (picture or video, resolution, `w`, `d`, gamma, crop or fit) and see the result at once;
- see **both** projectors joined, or only LEFT or only RIGHT;
- turn the **blend** off to compare, and show the **overlap edges**;
- **Like the wall**: adds the light of the two projectors (pixel value ^ projector gamma, 2.2 by default)
  instead of the pixel values, so the preview shows what a real projector pair shows. On the real
  projectors gamma 1.0 left a dark line and gamma 2.0 did not; this view shows the same;
- play, pause and seek a video; it loops;
- open and save settings files, and save the current picture;
- **Start on projector** runs `main.py` for the side you choose (with the shared start time if you typed one), in a separate window, on the
  projector screen. **Stop** closes it.

Wrong settings are shown as a message at the bottom, and the preview keeps the last good picture.

The GUI needs `tkinter`. Check it with `python -c "import tkinter"`. If that fails:

- Homebrew Python: `brew install python-tk@3.14`.
- Debian / Ubuntu: `sudo apt install python3-tk`.

The Python that uv downloads itself (`--managed-python`) includes `tkinter`, but in a virtual
environment the window can still fail with `Can't find a usable init.tcl`, although the import
works. This happened with uv 0.9.17 and Python 3.14.2 on macOS. Set `TCL_LIBRARY` and
`TK_LIBRARY` to the `lib/tcl8.6` and `lib/tk8.6` folders of that Python, which is in the folder
that `uv python dir` prints.

## Smoke test: full-screen on a chosen screen

`display.py` has a manual smoke test at the bottom of the file. It writes a
generated test picture to `images/sample.jpg`, loads it back through
`Image.load`, and shows it full-screen:

```bash
uv run python display.py
```

Press `q` or `ESC` to quit; the window also closes by itself after 30 s, so the
run can never hang unattended.

Edit the `screens` list inside the smoke test to match your desk layout — each
entry is `(x, y, width, height)` in **logical** pixels, and index 0 is the
monitor to show on.
